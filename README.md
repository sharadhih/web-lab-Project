# Project Name: Simple Login System

## Description

This project is a simple login system implemented using JavaScript. It consists of three pages: a signup page, a sign-in page, and a home page that displays a personalized welcome message for the user.

The signup page allows users to create an account by providing their name, email, and password. The entered information is validated, and upon successful signup, the user's data is stored locally.

The sign-in page verifies user credentials against the stored account information. If the provided email and password match an existing user, the user is directed to the home page.

The home page displays a welcome message using the user's name retrieved from local storage. Users can also log out from the home page, which redirects them to the sign-in page.
